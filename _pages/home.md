# Hello world,
Welcome to my blog. 

I have always been fan of graphics programming since my young age. 

Remember this kids?

I created these pages to share about my personnal projects.

On the professional side I work as a graphics engineer in a big game company and no I'm not currently looking for a job, thanks.

I'm still figuring out how this jekyll/markdown stuff works so I'm sorry if this blog is occasionaly broken.
