# Hello world

I have always been fan of graphics programming since the Amiga and created this blog to share about personal projects.

[VimontGames](https://vimontgames.github.io/) is the name of my (imaginary) game company; however, in reality, I am employed at a big French game studio.

<sub>I'm still figuring out how this jekyll/markdown stuff works so I'm sorry if this blog is occasionaly broken.</sub>
